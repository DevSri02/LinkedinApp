üíº LinkedIn Clone Backend ‚Äî Spring Boot Microservices Architecture
üß† Overview

A LinkedIn-like backend built using Spring Boot microservices, supporting:

User authentication and management

Connections (send and accept requests)

Notifications

Post sharing

All services communicate asynchronously via Apache Kafka and are registered dynamically using Eureka Server for service discovery.
The entire system is containerized with Docker and deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for scalability and fault tolerance.


üîÅ Kafka Topics
Topic Name	Producer	Consumer	Purpose
send-connection-request-topic	Connections Service	Notification Service	Notify user when someone sends a connection request
accept-connection-request-topic	Connections Service	Notification Service	Notify sender when their request is accepted

üß© Microservice Architecture

| Service                  | Port   | Description                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **api-gateway**          | `9090` | Routes client requests to respective services      |
| **user-service**         | `9020` | Handles user registration, login, and profile data |
| **connections-service**  | `9030` | Manages user connections (send/accept requests)    |
| **notification-service** | `9040` | Consumes Kafka events and notifies users           |
| **eureka-server**        | `8761` | Service registry for microservices                 |
